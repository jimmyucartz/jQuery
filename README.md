### Tasks

- 1.  Write a program that dynamically creates a button element with the text "Click Me" and appends it to a `<div>` with the ID "container". When the button is clicked, change the background color of the `<div>` to green.

- 2. Create a form with inputs for name, email, and password. Implement jQuery code to validate the form before submission. Display error messages next to invalid fields and prevent form submission if any field is empty or if the email format is incorrect.
